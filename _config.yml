      # Global default image is now at the top-level 'image'
      # Remove the 'image: /public/logo.png' from here if you want it handled globally by the top-level 'image'
      # Unless '/public/logo.png' is truly a different default for *all* pages/collections not explicitly covered
      # If your 'image: /public/ss.png' at the top is the general site default, this one can be removed or carefully managed.
