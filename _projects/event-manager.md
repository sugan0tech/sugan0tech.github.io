## Technical Implementation

* **Spring Boot**: Utilized Spring Boot framework for rapid development
* **REST APIs**: Designed and implemented RESTful endpoints for event operations
* **Hibernate**: Used Hibernate ORM for database interactions
* **Security**: Implemented authentication and authorization
* **Data Validation**: Applied robust input validation and error handling

## Key Features

* Event creation, updating, and management
* Student group registration and administration
* Attendance tracking and reporting
* Resource allocation for events
* Notification system for event updates

## Learning Outcomes

This project provided valuable real-world software development experience, including:

* Practical application of Spring Boot in a team environment
