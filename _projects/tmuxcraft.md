## Overview

TmuxCraft is a Go-based command-line tool that simplifies and enhances Tmux session management. Created as an alternative to Tmuxifier, it provides a more streamlined approach to creating, saving, and restoring complex Tmux environments.

## Motivation

As a developer who works extensively with terminal-based workflows, I wanted a more efficient way to manage my Tmux sessions with:

* Faster session creation
* Better configuration file syntax
* More intuitive command structure
* Cross-platform compatibility

## Implementation Details

* **Pure Go Implementation**: Written entirely in Go for performance and portability
* **YAML Configuration**: Uses YAML for session configuration files
* **Command Structure**: Intuitive CLI commands following modern CLI design patterns
* **State Management**: Efficient session state tracking and restoration

## Key Features

* Save and restore complex Tmux layouts
* Project-specific session templates
* Command completion for popular shells
* Session sharing capabilities
* Layout preview functionality

## Technical Challenges

* Implementing proper signal handling for Tmux interactions
* Ensuring backward compatibility with existing Tmux configurations
* Creating an intuitive and user-friendly command structure
* Managing cross-platform paths and environment variables

This project showcases my abilities in Go development and CLI tool design, while also demonstrating my focus on developer experience and workflow optimization.
