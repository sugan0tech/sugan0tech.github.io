<p class="message">
  A powerful Go-based CLI tool for creating, saving, and restoring complex Tmux environments with intuitive commands and efficient state management.
</p>

## Overview

TmuxCraft is a Go-based command-line tool that simplifies and enhances Tmux session management. Created as an alternative to Tmuxifier, it provides a more streamlined approach to creating, saving, and restoring complex Tmux environments. The tool is designed for developers who rely heavily on terminal-based workflows and need efficient ways to manage multiple projects.

## Motivation

As a developer who works extensively with terminal-based workflows, I wanted a more efficient way to manage my Tmux sessions with:
* Faster session creation and restoration
* Better configuration file syntax with modern YAML support
* More intuitive command structure following CLI best practices
* Cross-platform compatibility across Linux, macOS, and WSL environments

## Implementation Details

### Core Technology

* **Pure Go Implementation**: Written entirely in Go for performance and portability
* **YAML Configuration**: Human-readable YAML format for session definitions
* **Cobra CLI Framework**: Structured command hierarchy with proper subcommand support
* **State Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of session configurations

## Key Features

### Session Management

* **Template-Based Creation**: Define session layouts once, use them anywhere
* **Project Presets**: Automatically configure sessions based on project type (Go, Node.js, Python, etc.)
* **Command Completion**: Built-in completions for Bash, Zsh, and Fish shells
* **Persistent Storage**: Automatically save session state for quick restoration

### Developer Experience

* **Layout Preview**: Visualize session layouts before creation
* **Session Sharing**: Export and share configurations with team members
* **Smart Defaults**: Intelligent path handling and environment detection
* **Minimal Dependencies**: Single binary installation with no external requirements

### Advanced Capabilities

* **Hook System**: Pre/post session events for custom scripting
* **Layout Inheritance**: Build complex layouts from simpler templates
* **Remote Support**: Create and control sessions on remote hosts
* **Auto-Restoration**: Automatically restore sessions after system reboots

## Technical Challenges

### Tmux Interaction

* Implementing proper signal handling for Tmux interactions
* Parsing and generating valid Tmux commands across different versions
* Handling edge cases in window and pane management

### Cross-Platform Considerations

* Ensuring consistent behavior across different operating systems
* Managing path differences between platforms
* Handling terminal capabilities and color support

### User Experience

* Creating an intuitive and user-friendly command structure
* Balancing flexibility with simplicity in configuration options
* Providing helpful error messages and debugging information

## Learning Outcomes

This project enhanced my skills in:

* Building robust command-line applications in Go
* Designing intuitive developer tools with strong UX focus
* Working with system processes and terminal interactions
* Implementing effective configuration management systems
* Creating documentation that balances completeness with usability

TmuxCraft showcases my abilities in Go development and CLI tool design, while also demonstrating my focus on developer experience and workflow optimization for terminal-centric environments.
