## Overview

LifeFlow is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and enhance blood banking processes. It's built as a modular monolith application, combining the benefits of modularity with the simplicity of a monolithic deployment.

## Technical Details

* **Backend**: ASP.NET Core with clean architecture principles
* **Frontend**: React with modern component patterns
* **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server with Entity Framework Core for ORM
* **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
* **Architecture**: Modular monolith with clear boundary contexts

## Key Features

* Donor management and screening
* Blood inventory tracking and expiration management
* Compatibility testing and cross-matching
* Distribution and request handling
* Reporting and analytics dashboard
* Audit logging for regulatory compliance

## Implementation Highlights

* **Entity Framework Core**: Leveraged EF Core for database operations with a code-first approach
* **Repository Pattern**: Implemented repository pattern for data access abstraction
* **Service Layer**: Defined service layer for business logic separation
* **API Design**: RESTful API design with proper resource naming and status codes
* **React Components**: Built reusable React components with proper state management

## Outcomes & Lessons

This project was a significant milestone in my portfolio, showcasing my ability to design and implement a full-stack application with a focus on clean architecture and maintainability.

The modular approach allowed for clear separation of concerns while maintaining deployment simplicity, proving to be an effective architecture for domain-specific applications like blood banking systems.
