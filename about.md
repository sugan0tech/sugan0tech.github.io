## Backend Developer & System Architect

I am a Senior Backend Developer specializing in robust, secure and scalable systems. With extensive experience in cloud infrastructure and distributed systems, I focus on building high-performance applications using modern backend technologies.

My expertise spans Go, C#, Python, and Java, with a growing interest in functional programming paradigms like F#. I'm passionate about creating efficient, maintainable codebases and implementing DevOps best practices to streamline development workflows.

## Technical Focus Areas

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Extensive experience with AWS services and Azure AD
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Pulumi for automated deployments
- **Observability & Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana for system insights
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Security-First Development**: IAM, access boundaries, MFA enforcement
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions

## Professional Philosophy

I believe in building systems that are *functional* in both senses of the wordâ€”they work reliably and leverage functional programming principles for maintainability and scalability. My approach combines technical depth with practical solutions, focusing on long-term system health rather than quick fixes.

## Open Source Contributions

I actively contribute to several open-source projects and maintain my own tools for backend development and infrastructure automation. Visit my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/yourusername) to explore my work.
