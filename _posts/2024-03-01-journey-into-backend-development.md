title: My Journey into Backend Development
---

When I began my computing journey in 2016 at the age of 14, installing Ubuntu Unity on my first computer, I never imagined how deep I would venture into the world of software development. Today, as a backend engineer focused on building resilient, scalable systems, I'd like to share some reflections on my path.

## The Linux Beginning

My first experience with Linux was transformative. The ability to peek under the hood of an operating system, to modify and truly own my computing experience, sparked a curiosity that would shape my career path. I spent countless hours in terminal sessions, breaking and fixing my system, each cycle teaching me something new.

From those early days tinkering with bash scripts and system configurations, I developed an appreciation for robust, well-designed systems—a perspective that would later influence my approach to backend development.

## Finding My Focus

As I explored different areas of software development, I found myself consistently drawn to the backend—the intricate systems that power applications but remain invisible to most users. There's something deeply satisfying about designing efficient data flows, optimizing database queries, and building APIs that enable seamless experiences.

My academic journey formalized this interest, but the most valuable learning came from hands-on projects and internships. Working with real-world constraints—performance requirements, security considerations, scalability challenges—reinforced my passion for backend engineering.

## The Tools That Shaped Me

Over the years, I've worked with various languages and frameworks, each teaching me different lessons about software design:

* **C# and .NET**: Showed me the power of a comprehensive, well-designed ecosystem
* **Java**: Taught me object-oriented principles and enterprise patterns
* **Python**: Demonstrated the value of readability and rapid prototyping
* **Go**: Introduced me to concurrency models and simplicity in design
* **F#**: Currently opening my mind to functional programming paradigms

Beyond languages, my experience with cloud platforms and infrastructure tools has been equally formative. Learning to leverage AWS services, containerization with Docker, and infrastructure as code with Terraform has expanded my definition of what backend development encompasses.

## Looking Forward

As I continue to grow as a developer, I'm particularly excited about:

* Deepening my expertise in distributed systems design
* Exploring functional programming concepts for more robust applications
* Contributing to open-source projects that shape the future of backend development
* Mentoring the next generation of developers starting their own journeys

The backend landscape is constantly evolving, with new challenges and possibilities emerging regularly. This perpetual learning cycle—this need to constantly adapt and grow—is perhaps what I find most rewarding about the field.

I'll be sharing more specific technical insights in future posts, focusing on practical solutions to real-world backend challenges. Until then, I'd love to hear about your own development journey in the comments.
