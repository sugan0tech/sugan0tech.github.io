## Introduction

SpacetimeDB rethinks how we build backend systems by making the database the execution engine itself. Designed with real-time applications and games in mind, it eliminates the network boundary between backend and storage.

## What It Brings New to the Table

* **Module-based performance boost**: Native module support written in languages like C# and compiled to WASM gives ultra-low latency.
* **Better SDK structure**: Clean abstraction and binding generation simplify integration.
* **Distributed sync**: Built-in peer-to-peer synchronization of data across distributed nodes, unlike traditional client-server models.

## Purpose of SpacetimeDB

SpacetimeDB aims to be a **drop-in backend replacement for game developers** and real-time apps. It’s also excellent for rapid prototyping of scalable, high-performance systems.

## Getting Started with Development

### Basics & Initialization

```bash
# Initialize your module in C#
spacetime init spacetime-modules --lang csharp
spacetime build

# Publish your module
spacetime publish --project-path server unichat
```

### Setting up Client (React + TS)

```bash
npm create vite@latest unichat-client -- --template react-ts
cd unichat-client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Add dependencies

```bash
npm install react-router-dom@latest
npm install @clockworklabs/spacetimedb-sdk
npm install react-oidc-context oidc-client-ts
npm install @auth0/auth0-react
```

### Generate TS Bindings

```bash
spacetime generate --lang typescript --out-dir src/module_bindings --project-path ../spacetime-modules
```

### Sample C# Reducer Example

```csharp
using Spacetime;

[SpacetimeModule]
public partial class ChatModule : SpacetimeModule
{
    [Reducer]
    public static void SendMessage(
        Context ctx,
        string message,
        string roomId)
    {
        var chatRoom = ChatRoom.FirstOrDefault(r => r.Id == roomId);
        if (chatRoom == null)
        {
            throw new SpacetimeException("Room not found");
        }

        var newMessage = new Message
        {
            Sender = ctx.Identity.Id,
            Content = message,
            Timestamp = SystemTime.Now()
        };

        chatRoom.Messages.Add(newMessage);
    }
}
```

## Modules vs SDK Performance

Modules (WASM compiled logic) perform significantly better than pure SDK usage. For performance-critical systems, modules are the way to go.

## Fullstack Auth Flow with SpacetimeDB and Auth0

### UCAC (User Centric Access Control)

Introduces fine-grained, user-scoped control for row-level operations.

### RBAC for Admins

Global-level control using Role Based Access Control and policies.

## Internal Architecture

Includes a WASM execution layer that runs reducer logic inside the DB engine itself, providing secure, high-perf execution.

## WASM Layer Benefits

* Fast, safe execution
* Language-agnostic module support
* Sandboxed logic tightly coupled with DB state

## Comparison with Traditional Backends

* Removes need for external app + DB communication
* Lower latency
* Native replication and sync
* Less glue code and deployment complexity

## DevX (Developer Experience)

SpacetimeDB’s DX rivals modern backend frameworks, but with built-in real-time sync and persistence.

## Performance and Architecture Thoughts

While performance is key, it’s more about **removing bottlenecks** like network I/O and reducing SPOFs (Single Points of Failure).

## Things I Miss or Wish For

* Scaling is DB-style, not traditional backend-style
* Could benefit from an engine model like **TigerBeetleDB** for multi-node WASM exec

## Struggles Encountered

### Auth0 Integration Issue

While building [Unichat](https://github.com/sugan0tech/unichat), a real-time chat application using SpacetimeDB, I integrated Auth0 for authentication. Initially, SpacetimeDB couldn't verify Auth0's issued JWTs due to a failure in handling the provider's `well-known` JWKS URL for public key discovery.

This caused the server to reject valid Auth0 tokens. As a workaround, I patched the `token_validation.rs` file locally. Fortunately, this issue was resolved officially in SpacetimeDB's **alpha build as of April 17, 2025**.

Here’s a brief of how my app handles authentication:

#### Backend Reducers (C#)

```csharp
[Table(Name = "user", Public = true)]
public partial class User {
  [PrimaryKey] public Identity id;
  public string? name;
}

[Table(Name = "message", Public = true)]
public partial class Message {
  [PrimaryKey] public ulong id;
  public Identity sender;
  public Identity receiver;
  public string content = "";
  public Timestamp timestamp;
}

[Reducer]
public static void RegisterUser(ReducerContext ctx, string name) {
  var user = ctx.Db.user.id.Find(ctx.Sender);
  if (user is null) {
    ctx.Db.user.Insert(new User { id = ctx.Sender, name = name });
  }
}

[Reducer]
public static void SendMessage(ReducerContext ctx, Identity to, string content) {
  ctx.Db.message.Insert(new Message {
    id = ctx.Db.message.Count + 1,
    sender = ctx.Sender,
    receiver = to,
    content = content,
    timestamp = ctx.Timestamp
  });
}

[Reducer]
public static void SetName(ReducerContext ctx, string name) {
  name = ValidateName(name);
  var user = ctx.Db.user.id.Find(ctx.Sender);
  if (user is not null) {
    user.name = name;
    ctx.Db.user.id.Update(user);
  }
}

private static string ValidateName(string name) {
  if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(name)) {
    throw new Exception("Names must not be empty");
  }
  return name;
}
```

#### Frontend Connection (React + TS)

```ts
const { getAccessTokenSilently } = useAuth0();
const token = await getAccessTokenSilently({
  authorizationParams: {
    audience: 'https://your-auth-audience-url'
  }
});

await spacetimeService.connectWithToken(token);
await spacetimeService.registerUser("DefaultName");
```

Now that the validation bug has been fixed upstream, integration with Auth0 works seamlessly out of the box.

## Notes on Future Adoption and Stability

While SpacetimeDB is extremely promising, developers should be aware that the project is evolving rapidly and may introduce **breaking API changes** in upcoming releases. Especially as it moves toward production readiness, internal structures, SDK interfaces, and even WASM runtime behaviors may shift.

Despite its initial positioning for **game development**, SpacetimeDB has strong potential in **niche, latency-sensitive backend use cases** beyond gaming — such as collaborative editing, IoT coordination, real-time dashboards, or multiplayer educational platforms. Its unified DB+logic architecture can simplify traditionally complex system designs in these domains.

## Conclusion

SpacetimeDB represents a **fundamental shift**—a backend engine and database merged into one, removing traditional server‑DB boundaries. For backend engineers, this means writing and deploying business logic **inside the database** itself via WASM reducers, unlocking ultra‑low latency and greatly simplified operations.

While the platform is young and subject to change, any team building **real‑time, stateful, distributed applications** should absolutely explore it. With commercial adoption (e.g., BitCraft) and growing community support, SpacetimeDB is poised to reshape backend design—and I’m excited to see where it goes next.
